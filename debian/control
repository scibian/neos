Description: HPC job sessions manager framework
 This package contains the NEOS software which provides a generic framework to
 manage job sessions on HPC clusters.
 .
 The framework is based on scenarios. A scenario defines the sequential steps
 to properly setup and initialize the job session. Users select the scenario
 for their jobs and can even define their own scenarios. The frawework can
 manage a wide variety of workloads from classic MPI parallel computing to
 advanced visualization sessions with 3D remote rendering.
 .
 NEOS is fully integrated with open-source Slurm workload manager and modules
 environment manager.
 .
 This package should be installed on all nodes (frontends as well as compute
 nodes).
